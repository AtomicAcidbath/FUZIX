SDCC:

	This patch adds 

	1. Helpers to cut down the size of C code for function entry. Right
	   now the __enter and __enter_s must be in common memory.

	2. An option --external-banker that keeps 4 byte stack offsets for
	   arguments so the linker can patch up banked binaries. Unbanked
	   code is called via push af call foo pop af
