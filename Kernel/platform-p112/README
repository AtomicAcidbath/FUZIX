This is Fuzix for the DX-Designs P112
By Will Sowerbutts <will@sowerbutts.com>

Assumes a P112 fitted with 1024KB RAM and G-IDE

Can boot from a floppy -- write "fuzix-boot.fdd" to floppy and boot it in the
first drive on the P112: dd if=platform-p112/fuzix-boot.fdd bs=512 of=/dev/fd0

Only supported storage device at this time is the G-IDE

To build, edit ../Makefile to read:

export TARGET= p112
export CPU = z180
